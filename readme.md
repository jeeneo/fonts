my attempt to stay relevant and reverse engineer how one might add custom fonts on Samsung devices (OneUI 8)

i just made this in a few hours so expect bugs, and dont use for production unless you're comfortable with having your font packages have a public keyfile with a viewable password (WIP)

its kinda thrown together (look its text replacement instead of apk decompiling)

im lazy?
