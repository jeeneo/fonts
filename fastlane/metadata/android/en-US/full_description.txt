<p>Install and manage fonts on One UI 8</p>

<p>This is a rootless font installer for Samsung devices running One UI 8.</p>
<p>It's like zFont, but if it was ad-free, open source, heavily limited, offline and completely manual. And only supported One UI 8. Cool!</p>

<p>It can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>install fonts (ttf only)</li>
    <li>uninstall fonts (le gasp)</li>
    <li>preview fonts (woah getting dizzy from the features)</li>
    <li>use shizuku (not required but simplifies installs)</li>
</ul>

<p>It can't:</p>
<ul>
    <li>work on anything prior to One UI 8 or non-samsung phones</li>
    <li>fold your dishes</li>
    <li>wash your cat</li>
</ul>

<p>It won't:</p>
<ul>
    <li>support anything other than One UI 8 (not planned)</li>
</ul>

<p>(cat washing support is planned™ /s /j)</p>
